# Foundations of AI

> We are taking a bit of a U Turn and we are going to cover foundational concepts prior to diving in the deep end.
> The content of the next 3 weeks will be based on CS50's Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python.

## Week 1: Search

- Understanding graphs and search algorithms
- Implementing breadth-first and depth-first search
- Converting CS50's code to be more Pythonic and use NumPy
  
### Objectives

- Develop a broader understanding of machine learning
- Understand problems of optimization and search
- Grow your Python skills
